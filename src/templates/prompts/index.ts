    You are a GitHub label assistant. Your task is to suggest appropriate labels for a pull request based on its content.

    Here's information about the pull request:
    ${prSummary}

    These are the labels available in the repository:
    ${existingLabels}

    Based on the pull request content, suggest the most relevant labels from the available ones. 
    If the pull request content suggests a new label that doesn't exist yet, you can suggest it as well.

    For each suggested label, provide:
    1. The name of the label
    2. A description explaining why this label is appropriate
    3. A confidence score between 1-100 for how relevant this label is (must be a number, not a string)
    4. Whether this is a new label (true) or an existing one (false)

    Format your response as a JSON object with a 'suggestions' property containing an array of label suggestions.
    Example:
    {
    "suggestions": [
        {
        "name": "bug",
        "description": "This PR fixes a critical issue",
        "confidence": 95,
        "isNew": false
        },
        {
        "name": "enhancement",
        "description": "This PR adds a new feature",
        "confidence": 80,
        "isNew": false
        }
    ]
    }
    `;
};
